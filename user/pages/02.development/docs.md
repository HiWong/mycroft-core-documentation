## Cerberus Device and Account Manager
Mycroft AI, Inc. - the company behind Mycroft maintains the Cerberus device and account management system. Developers can sign up at https://cerberus.mycroft.ai

Once signed up you can pair a device and use our API keys for services, such as the STT (Speech-to-Text) API. It also uses allows you to use our API keys for weather, Wolfram-Alpha, and various other skills.

If you do not wish to use our service, you may insert your own API keys into the configuration file.

## Configuration
Mycroft configuration consists of 3 possible config files.
- `defaults.ini`, which lives inside the mycroft codebase/distribution
- `/etc/mycroft/mycroft.ini`
- `$HOME/.mycroft/mycroft.ini`

When the configuration loader starts, it looks in those locations in that order, and loads ALL configuration. Keys that exist in multiple config files will be overridden by the last file to contain that config value. This results in a minimal amount of config being written for a specific device/user, without modifying the distribution files.

## Starting the Virtualenv
To ensure that you are in the Mycroft virtualenv before trying to start the services, as everything is installed there, Run:
```
workon mycroft
```

### Running the initial stack
- run `PYTHONPATH=. python client/speech/main.py` # the main speech detection loop, which prints events to stdout and broadcasts them to a message bus
- run `PYTHONPATH=. python client/messagebus/service/main.py` # the main message bus, implemented via web sockets
- run `PYTHONPATH=. python client/skills/main.py` # main skills executable, loads all skills under skills dir

### Running stack via the script
- run `./start.sh service`
- run `./start.sh skills`
- run `./start.sh voice`
